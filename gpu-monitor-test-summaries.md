## Branch: fix-gpu-detection-all-containers

### Test Summary

**Approach**: Use nvidia-container-toolkit with nvidia-docker runtime and custom GPU metrics script

**Key Changes**:
1. Created custom GPU monitoring script that uses nvidia-smi to track GPU processes
2. Maps PIDs to containers using cgroup inspection and nsenter
3. Provides metrics for ALL containers (not just those currently using GPU)
4. Detects containers with GPU access capabilities

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Successfully detects containers with nvidia runtime
- ✅ Maps GPU processes to correct containers
- ✅ Reports 0% usage for GPU-enabled containers not currently using GPU
- ❌ **Ollama GPU usage NOT detected** - Same limitation as nvidia-smi
- ❌ Requires privileged access for PID namespace operations

**Metrics Provided**:
- `docker_container_gpu_usage_percent` - Binary indicator (1.0 = has GPU activity, 0.0 = no activity)
- `docker_container_gpu_memory_usage_bytes` - Actual GPU memory usage per container

## Branch: gpu-monitor-ebpf

### Test Summary

**Approach**: Use eBPF kernel hooks to trace GPU usage

**Test Results**: ❌ **FAILED** - Cannot compile eBPF programs in WSL2

**Failure Reasons**:
1. Container environment lacks kernel headers needed for eBPF compilation
2. BPF compilation requires kernel development headers not available in containers
3. eBPF programs need privileged kernel access difficult to achieve in containers

**Error Details**:
```
Unable to find kernel headers. Try rebuilding kernel with CONFIG_IKHEADERS=m
chdir(/lib/modules/6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2/build): No such file or directory
Exception: Failed to compile BPF module
```

**Conclusion**: eBPF approach would require the monitoring container to have kernel headers and elevated privileges, making it impractical for containerized deployment.

## Branch: gpu-monitor-kernel-direct

### Test Summary

**Approach**: Direct kernel /proc/driver/nvidia access, bypassing nvidia-smi

**Test Results**: ❌ **FAILED** - Container runtime issues in WSL2

**Failure Reasons**:
1. Container requires extensive host privileges to access kernel interfaces
2. Read-only filesystem errors when trying to access /proc/sys from container
3. Runtime conflicts - Need host PID namespace and privileged mode

**Error Details**:
```
open /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_unprivileged_port_start: read-only file system
open /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range: read-only file system
```

**Planned Approach**:
- Read /proc/driver/nvidia/* for GPU information
- Scan /proc/*/maps for processes using NVIDIA/CUDA libraries
- Access /sys/kernel/debug/dri for memory allocation info
- Bypass nvidia-smi and NVML entirely

**Conclusion**: Kernel direct approach requires such elevated container privileges that it defeats the purpose of containerization and creates security concerns.

## Branch: gpu-monitor-nvml-events

### Test Summary

**Approach**: Use NVML event API to monitor GPU state changes

**Test Results**: ❌ **FAILED** - NVML event API not properly exposed in pynvml

**Failure Reasons**:
1. Missing event constants - pynvml doesn't expose NVML_EVENT_* constants
2. Limited Python bindings - The Python library doesn't fully implement event APIs
3. API mismatch - nvmlEventSetCreate() and related functions not available

**Error Details**:
```python
AttributeError: module 'pynvml' has no attribute 'NVML_EVENT_PCI_ERRORS'
```

**Root Cause**: The Python bindings for NVML (nvidia-ml-py) are incomplete. While the C library supports event monitoring, these features weren't ported to the Python wrapper.

**Conclusion**: NVML event monitoring would require using the C NVML library directly or creating custom Python bindings. Not viable with current pynvml library.

## Branch: gpu-monitor-nvtop

### Test Summary

**Approach**: Use gpustat tool which claims to detect workloads that nvidia-smi misses

**Test Results**: ❌ **FAILED** - Ollama GPU usage NOT detected

**Test Details**:
1. gpustat installed successfully ✅
2. Metrics collector running ✅  
3. Prometheus metrics exported ✅
4. Ollama workload NOT detected ❌

**Technical Details**:
When running Ollama inference:
```json
{
    "gpus": [{
        "memory.used": 9746,  // Memory is allocated
        "processes": []       // But NO processes detected!
    }]
}
```

**Conclusion**: gpustat suffers from the same limitation as nvidia-smi - it cannot detect modern ML workloads like Ollama that use GPU memory and compute without appearing in the process list.

## Branch: gpu-monitor-runtime-injection

### Test Summary

**Approach**: Runtime injection of monitoring scripts into running containers

**Test Results**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Injection works but same limitations

**Successes**:
1. Injected monitors into GPU containers ✅
2. Collected metrics from inside containers ✅
3. No container modifications needed ✅
4. Works with existing containers ✅

**Failures**:
- Ollama GPU usage NOT detected ❌
- The injected script still relies on nvidia-smi inside containers
- Same fundamental limitation - Ollama workloads are invisible to nvidia-smi

**Technical Details**: The injection successfully created monitoring scripts inside containers and ran them in background, collecting metrics via docker exec. However, the monitoring script still uses nvidia-smi, which cannot see Ollama workloads.

**Interesting Finding**: The Ollama container uses NVIDIA environment variables but "runc" runtime instead of "nvidia" runtime, which might be why it wasn't detected as a GPU container.

**Conclusion**: Runtime injection is a clever approach that works technically, but doesn't solve the fundamental problem of Ollama being invisible to NVIDIA's standard monitoring tools.

## Overall Summary

### Test Results Overview

| Branch | Approach | Result | Key Issue |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| fix-gpu-detection-all-containers | nvidia-smi + PID mapping | ❌ Failed | Cannot detect Ollama workloads |
| gpu-monitor-ebpf | eBPF kernel hooks | ❌ Failed | No kernel headers in WSL2 |
| gpu-monitor-kernel-direct | Direct /proc access | ❌ Failed | Container/WSL2 permissions |
| gpu-monitor-nvml-events | NVML event API | ❌ Failed | Incomplete Python bindings |
| gpu-monitor-nvtop | gpustat tool | ❌ Failed | Same limits as nvidia-smi |
| gpu-monitor-runtime-injection | Container injection | ❌ Failed | Still uses nvidia-smi |

### Key Findings

1. **Fundamental Limitation**: Modern ML workloads like Ollama allocate GPU memory and perform computations in ways invisible to traditional NVIDIA monitoring tools (nvidia-smi, NVML).

2. **Container Constraints**: Several approaches failed due to containerization limitations:
   - eBPF requires kernel headers not available in containers
   - Kernel direct access needs excessive privileges
   - Security isolation prevents deep system access

3. **All Approaches Failed**: None of the tested approaches successfully detected Ollama GPU usage. While some approaches (like fix-gpu-detection-all-containers and runtime-injection) could detect traditional GPU workloads, they all failed with modern ML frameworks.

4. **Container Runtime Issues**: Ollama uses "runc" runtime with NVIDIA environment variables instead of "nvidia" runtime, making detection more challenging.

### Conclusion

**No viable solution found** for detecting Ollama and similar modern ML workloads' GPU usage. All approaches tested suffer from the same fundamental limitation:

- Modern ML frameworks (Ollama, LLMs, etc.) allocate GPU memory and perform computations through methods that bypass traditional NVIDIA monitoring APIs
- nvidia-smi, NVML, and tools built on them cannot see these workloads
- Even advanced approaches like eBPF and kernel direct access face technical barriers in containerized environments due to security isolation

### Implications

This represents a significant gap in GPU observability for modern AI/ML workloads. Container orchestration and resource management systems relying on these metrics will be blind to actual GPU usage by these frameworks.
